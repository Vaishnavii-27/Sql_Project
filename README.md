🍕 Pizza Sales Data Analysis using SQL

This project analyzes a Pizza Sales dataset using structured SQL queries ranging from basic aggregation to advanced analytical techniques. The goal is to extract meaningful business insights that help improve revenue strategy, customer understanding, and operational efficiency.

📌 Project Overview

The analysis is divided into **three levels of SQL complexity**:

🔹 Basic Level Analysis

Focused on fundamental SQL operations such as `SELECT`, `COUNT`, `SUM`, `GROUP BY`, and `ORDER BY`.

✔ Retrieve the total number of orders placed
✔ Calculate the total revenue generated from pizza sales
✔ Identify the highest-priced pizza
✔ Identify the most common pizza size ordered
✔ List the top 5 most ordered pizza types along with their quantities

🔹 Intermediate Level Analysis

Applied joins, grouping, and time-based analysis for deeper business insights.

✔ Join tables to find total quantity ordered per pizza category
✔ Analyze order distribution by hour of the day
✔ Category-wise pizza distribution
✔ Average number of pizzas ordered per day
✔ Top 3 pizza types based on revenue

🔹 Advanced Level Analysis

Used window functions and analytical SQL techniques.

✔ Percentage contribution of each pizza type to total revenue
✔ Cumulative revenue analysis over time
✔ Top 3 revenue-generating pizzas within each category
